## Getting Started (with Expo)

If you are using Expo Cli, clone the repo and run "expo start" in the root folder of the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/instamobile/react-native-firebase.git
cd react-native-firebase
expo start
```

## Getting Started (without Expo)

If you prefer using React Native CLI, you'll need to eject from Expo first:

```
git clone https://github.com/instamobile/react-native-firebase.git
cd react-native-firebase
expo eject
npm install
react-native run-android // react-native run-ios
```

This React Native Firebase starter is built with Firebase Web SDK, which makes it compatible with both Expo CLI and React Native CLI.
